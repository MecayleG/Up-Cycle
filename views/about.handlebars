        <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p> We at Up-Cycle strongly believe in the benefits that recycling has on our beautiful planet, but it order to make a big difference
        we have to start small. We hope to mostly impact the lives of people who make a living off recycling or even those who knew nothing about it by simply
        giving them everything they need to know in one place.
