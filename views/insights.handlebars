        <p class="card-text"> When we recycle, used materials are converted into new products, reducing the need to
          consume natural resources.
          If used materials are not recycled, new products are made by extracting fresh, raw material from the Earth,
          through mining and forestry.

      producing new products from raw materials – even when comparing all associated costs including transport etc. Plus
      there are extra energy savings because more energy is required to extract, refine, transport
      and process raw materials ready for industry compared with providing industry-ready materials.</p>

      all of which create substantial air and water pollution. As recycling saves energy it also reduces greenhouse gas
      emissions, which helps to tackle climate change. Current SA recycling is estimated to save
      more than 18 million tonnes of CO2 a year – the equivalent to taking 5 million cars off the road.</p>
